In-game Browser is a mod to render browsers in game based on MCEF(https://github.com/LuZWCHA/mcef/tree/dev)

## Content
Provide a way to summon a Browser Entity in game and do 3D-render.

The Entity **ONLY** spawn at the client world, so other players at the game world won't get a Browser in their own WORLD.

To share the web page, you need to share the URL with other players. This mod will not do any synchronization, because that is really a challenging work.
